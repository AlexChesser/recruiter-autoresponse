# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

Thanks so much for reaching out. I’m always interested in hearing about new and exciting opportunities.

As a software engineer, I get a very high volume of recruiters contacting me on LinkedIn, so I don’t have time for phone calls with everyone.

Incoming opportunities often represent a very poor fit, so before we continue our conversation, I’d like to ask about the level of seniority that you’re looking for.

Can you send along the company name, job description, and compensation details for the role? Without this information, I am unavailable for further discussion.

Thanks again for reaching out. I look forward to hearing from you.

Alex
